#css selector ( cascading style sheet )
-----------------------------------------
css selector only support the two locators
1.ID
2.CLASS

//-parent node
/-child node
@-fetching point

why css selector is faster ?
-------------------------------
> Because of node xpath in the body tag searched every tag and attribute but
 css selector goes to .css file and fetch their class and goto the locator so that the css selector is much more faster .

Basic syntax
------------
tag name -input, div, span.
#id
.class_name
attribute

combined selector
------------------
div.classname
with help of the tag

css selector is static
